Survivor of Makers Academy, an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp where I learnt how to learn. Mainly focused on coding cleanly in Ruby and now hoping to secure a job as a Junior Backend Developer or DevOps.

I'd like to be adopted by a clever, curious (and hopefully very skilled) team who write software to try to take over the world (or just be really useful to other people).

I made peace with the feeling of discomfort and working past the limit of my current knowledge. Now I can code. Hire me?

Skills
------

### Understanding humans
I like to help other humans. During hiring week of Makers, I gave a presentation to my cohort and some coaches to educate them about a recruiter's perspective to hiring.  
I also coached at Rails Girls the very next day following my own graduation.

### Problem-solving
When it comes to programming I love to break things apart and see if they can fit back together in new ways. Often, they don't play so nice. I like to fiddle around in the big connected mess called the internet. I'm good at finding the right resources for the job. There are *so* many gems that do what I need. I didn't find a [gem](https://github.com/GeekG1rl/rspect_rspec_formatter) that would prettify RSpec output so I only went and made it with my awesome team.

### Communication
I have the ability to explain complex techie jargon to your grandma. Try me. I even contributed to the course materials as I was able to put words together into easier to follow sentences. 

### Giving clear, concise instructions
This is how I like my tea:  
1. No milk or sugar  
2. Teabag into mug  
3. 60% boiling water   
4. 40% cold water  
5. Teabag out
